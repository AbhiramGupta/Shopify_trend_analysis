# Shopify Product Trend & Pricing Analytics (2025)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes Shopify product data to understand **what drives product trends** on the platform.  
The analysis focuses on **pricing, category, subcategory, and product-level performance** to identify key factors influencing trend momentum.

The goal is to demonstrate an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from data cleaning to SQL analysis and interactive dashboarding.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard includes:

### 🔹 Overview Page
- Total products, revenue, units sold, and average trend score  
- Category-level revenue and sales performance  
- Price vs trend score relationship  

### 🔹 Category & Subcategory Analysis
- Average trend score by category

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Product price alone does **not strongly influence trend score**  
- Fitness and Beauty categories consistently show high trend momentum  
- Certain subcategories achieve high trend scores at mid-range prices  
- Trend score reflects **engagement momentum**, not long-term quality
